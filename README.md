# YTML: Write HTML using YAML while templating with YTE

YTML allows to define HTML tags in YAML syntax, usually leading to significantly less code.
In combination with [YTE](https://yte-template-engine.github.io), you can perform arbitrary templating.
Unlike other many approaches for templating, YTE/YTML is always valid YAML.

Note: Unlike YTE which is mature and fully tested, YTML is a prototype and still mostly undocumented.
Nevertheless, it is stable and usable.
